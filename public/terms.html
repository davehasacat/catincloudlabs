          <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
          <p>
            “CatInCloud Labs,” operated by <strong>DaveHasACat LLC</strong> (Minnesota, USA), provides cloud and data
            engineering services and publishes information on this website (<code>catincloudlabs.com</code>).
          </p>

          <h2>2) What these terms cover</h2>
          <p>
            These terms cover your use of our website and—unless a separate agreement says otherwise—any informal discovery
            calls, estimates, and proposals we share with you. If we sign a <em>Master Services Agreement (MSA)</em> or
            <em>Statement of Work (SOW)</em>, those documents control if there's a conflict.
          </p>

          <h2>3) Not legal, tax, or investment advice</h2>
          <p>
            Content on this site is for general information. It's not legal, tax, accounting, or investment advice. You should
            consult your own advisors before relying on anything here.
          </p>

          <h2>4) Acceptable use</h2>
          <p>
            You agree not to misuse the site (for example, no scraping at abusive rates, no security testing without consent,
            no disrupting service, and no posting or transmitting harmful content). We may suspend access for abuse.
          </p>

          <h2>5) Intellectual property</h2>
          <p>
            All site content (text, graphics, logos, diagrams) is owned by CatInCloud Labs or its licensors and is protected by
            applicable laws. You may link to our site and share brief excerpts with attribution. Do not republish full pages,
            copy our branding, or create misleading derivatives without written permission.
          </p>

          <h2>6) Engagements and deliverables</h2>
          <p>
            Project work, deliverables, licensing, and acceptance criteria are defined in an MSA/SOW. Unless stated otherwise in
            an SOW, deliverables are provided for your internal business use. You are responsible for operating them in your
            environment, including cloud costs, user access, and change management.
          </p>

          <h2>7) Fees and payment (summary)</h2>
          <p>
            Any pricing, invoicing cadence, and payment terms are defined in the applicable SOW. If not otherwise stated,
            invoices are due net-15.
          </p>

          <h2>8) Confidentiality</h2>
          <p>
            We each may receive confidential information from the other during discussions or delivery. We'll protect each other's
            confidential information with at least reasonable care and use it only for the intended purpose.
          </p>

          <h2>9) Warranties and disclaimers</h2>
          <p>
            We provide the website “as is.” To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties (express,
            implied, or statutory), including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. For
            services, any warranties are only those explicitly stated in an MSA/SOW.
          </p>

          <h2>10) Limitation of liability</h2>
          <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, neither party is liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
            or punitive damages. Our total liability for claims related to the website will not exceed <strong>USD $100</strong>.
            For paid services, any liability caps or remedies will be specified in the MSA/SOW.
          </p>

          <h2>11) Indemnity</h2>
          <p>
            You agree to indemnify and hold CatInCloud Labs (and its members) harmless from third-party claims arising from
            your unlawful use of the site or violation of these terms.
          </p>

          <h2>12) Third-party links and tools</h2>
          <p>
            Our site may link to third-party sites or tools. We don't control them and aren't responsible for their content
            or policies.
          </p>

          <h2>13) Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            See our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for how we handle personal information.
          </p>

          <h2>14) Security and reporting</h2>
          <p>
            We take security seriously and prefer private, responsible disclosure. See
            <a href="/.well-known/security.txt">security.txt</a> for our contact details and
            <a href="/security">Security</a> for our human-readable policy.
          </p>

          <h2>15) Changes to these terms</h2>
          <p>
            We may update these terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we'll update the “Last updated” date.
          </p>

          <h2>16) Governing law &amp; venue</h2>
          <p>
            These terms are governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota. Courts in Hennepin County, Minnesota have exclusive jurisdiction.
