          <!-- How I work -->
          <article class="card reveal card--narrow">
            <h2>How I think about the work</h2>
            <p>
              I care about systems that actually work in production: clear architecture, predictable behavior, and a level of
              complexity that matches the team operating it. CatInCloud Labs is run by me, Dave Anaya, a cloud and data engineer
              who tries to make platforms understandable, documented, and practical to live with.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm not trying to chase every new tool. I'd rather help you get more value out of what you already have, add structure
              where it's missing, and leave behind patterns your team feels comfortable owning.
            </p>
          </article>

          <!-- Security / clarity -->
          <article class="card reveal card--narrow">
            <h2>Private by default, built to be lived with</h2>
            <p>
              A lot of my work starts with foundations: private networking, least-privilege IAM, KMS-encrypted storage, and
              observability that makes it clear when something is off. The aim is a stack you can rely on in day-to-day operations,
              not just during a demo.
            </p>
            <p>
              From there, it's about steady, deliberate improvements, with a focus on well-scoped changes that fit your constraints and
              make life easier, rather than create technical debt.
            </p>
          </article>

          <!-- Tech stack -->
          <article class="card reveal card--narrow">
            <h2>The stack I focus on</h2>
            <p>
              I focus on AWS + Snowflake + dbt pipelines, often orchestrated with AWS MWAA (Airflow). That usually means:
              S3-based ingestion, Snowflake as the warehouse, dbt for transformations and tests, and Airflow for scheduling and
              coordination.
            </p>
            <p>
              Those are the tools I know best, so I lean on patterns I've tested in my own reference stack and adapt them to your
              environment, team, and roadmap.

              If you're working with or thinking of adopting some version of this stack, and want things to feel calmer
              and more predictable, a short discovery call is a good place to start. We can walk through what you have today and see
              whether there's a useful project to tackle together.
