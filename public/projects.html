            <p>
              A production-grade pipeline built on AWS, MWAA, Snowflake, and dbt, designed to ingest and transform stock and options data
              in a private VPC. It uses KMS-encrypted S3 buckets, VPC endpoints, and incremental dbt models to keep data flowing reliably
              from raw JSON to analytics-ready marts.

            <p class="muted">
              This is the same architecture pattern I adapt for client environments that want calm, well-understood data platforms.

                    <strong>QQQ is used for protection.</strong>
                    Look at the Options Chain table for QQQ. The top active contracts are frequently <strong>Puts</strong> (betting on downside). 
                    Institutions use these liquid indices to hedge their portfolios against tech selloffs.
                  </li>

                    <strong>GME is pure speculation.</strong>
                    Switch the selector to GME. The top contracts are almost exclusively <strong>Calls</strong>. 
                    There is virtually no hedging visible here; the flow is entirely focused on speculative upside bursts.

                    <strong>The "New Index" behavior.</strong>
                    Historically, SPY volumes dwarf single stocks. But in this window, <strong>NVDA's top contracts often traded higher volume than SPY's.</strong> 
                    This signals that for many traders, NVDA has effectively become the market proxy. NVDA is the center of gravity for liquidity and attention.

                    <strong>Benchmarks anchor the room.</strong>
                    SPY and QQQ maintain a steady, lower volatility profile (typically 10-15% annualized). They act as the "control group" 
                    against which the idiosyncratic risk of single names like GME (which lives in its own disconnected volatility reality) is measured.

                    bursty, erratic flow of GME, without manual intervention. It proves the ELT architecture can scale across the

            <h2>Future: Machine learning on top of calm pipelines</h2>
            <p>
              The same stock + options pipeline that powers these charts is already keeping months of joined history in clean Snowflake marts.
              When it's the right time, that foundation can support light-weight machine learning without changing the core stack or adding
              a lot of moving parts.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Detect unusual options flow or volatility regimes for a given ticker, based on recent behavior.</li>
              <li>Generate “what changed this week and why it matters” summaries directly from the daily features snapshot.</li>
              <li>Build simple, well-behaved models to forecast volume, volatility, or regimes using only the data the pipeline already maintains.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="muted">
              Status: Not actively building yet. The focus today is on keeping the pipeline calm, explainable, and easy to operate, with the option
              to layer in ML later where it clearly helps decision making.

            If these examples look close to what you need in your own stack, the next step
            is a short discovery call.
