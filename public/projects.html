            <p>
              A production-grade pipeline built on AWS, MWAA, Snowflake, and dbt, designed to ingest and transform stock and options data
              in a private VPC. It uses KMS-encrypted S3 buckets, VPC endpoints, and incremental dbt models to keep data flowing reliably
              from raw JSON to analytics-ready marts.
            </p>
            <p class="muted">
              This is the same architecture pattern I adapt for client environments that want calm, well-understood data platforms.

                  <li>
                    <strong>More up days than crash days.</strong>
                    Across AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and NVDA you see more +1-4% days than sharp selloffs, and most pullbacks get bought back within a few sessions.

                  <li>
                    <strong>AAPL climbs through choppy sessions, not one giant move.</strong>
                    It walks from the high-220s into the high-270s through a series of noisy days, which reads as a “choppy uptrend with event-driven bursts” rather than a calm drift or crash regime.

                    <strong>Volume spikes in clusters, not randomly.</strong>
                    For AAPL, “normal” options flow is about 1-1.5M contracts a day; on hotspots like 2025-09-19 and 09-22 it jumps into the 5M+ range.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>“3× crowd days” stand out quickly.</strong>
                    The 7-day average line and the <code>option_volume_vs_30d</code> feature make it easy to see when today is two to three times louder than the recent baseline without having to remember what “normal” looks like.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>NVDA is structurally loud.</strong>
                    It routinely trades 5-9M contracts a day with 7-day averages north of 5M even when spot is oscillating in a tight band—that's what a crowded options tape looks like.

                    <strong>Elevated but not chaotic.</strong>
                    AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT mostly live in the 20-30% annualized realized-vol range; NVDA tends to run hotter; MSFT is the relative “calm anchor” even as it grinds to new highs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Distinct “vol personalities.”</strong>
                    NVDA is consistently punchier, MSFT is steadier, and GOOGL has a brief early patch of very high vol before settling into a more normal band.

                    <strong>Flow clusters in short-dated calls near the money.</strong>
                    The top-contracts table shows activity focused in short-dated calls around nearby strikes (for example, 260-280 for AAPL, ~180-210 for NVDA, ~500-550 for MSFT), with puts showing up as the exception.
                  </li>

                    <strong>Upside speculation dominates.</strong>
                    That mix suggests a window skewed toward upside speculation or call-heavy hedging rather than quiet downside protection in puts.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Expired but important contracts remain visible.</strong>
                    Many of the most active contracts now show DTE = 0 and a last price of $0.01, which is exactly what you'd expect for short-dated options that were heavily traded during the window and have since expired.

                  <li>
                    <strong>One row per day, plenty of signal.</strong>
                    The snapshot export gives each ticker a daily state: short-horizon returns, realized vol, underlying volume,
                    options volume versus a 30-day baseline, and call/put mix.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Designed for heads of data, not traders.</strong>
                    It's enough to answer “Is today normal or weird?”, “Is this rally being chased in options?”, or “Is this selloff being hedged or faded?” without staring at raw trade logs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Built for downstream dashboards and models.</strong>
                    The goal isn't to predict the market; it's to give dashboards, alerts, and models a clean, warehouse-native view of price action and options behavior instead of one-off CSVs scattered across laptops.

            <h2>Private MWAA Environment</h2>
            <p>
              A hardened Airflow deployment running on AWS MWAA inside a fully private VPC. MWAA connects to ECR, CloudWatch Logs, KMS,
              Secrets Manager, and S3 through VPC endpoints. This ensures orchestration, logging, and image pulls all happen without public internet
              access.
            </p>
            <p class="muted">
              The same approach can be used to keep your schedulers and control plane traffic private while still integrating cleanly with
              AWS services and your data warehouse.

            <p>
              A browser-based analytics layer built with tools like Plotly Dash on top of Snowflake marts. The goal is to provide
              straightforward views into pipeline health and market data without adding another brittle surface area to maintain.
            </p>
            <p class="muted">
              As the core platform stabilizes, these kinds of dashboards and lightweight apps become much easier to add safely.
