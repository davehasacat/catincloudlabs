            <h2>Enterprise Stock Market ELT (reference implementation)</h2>
            <p>
              A production-grade pipeline built on AWS, MWAA, Snowflake, and dbt, designed to ingest and transform stock and options data
              in a private VPC. It uses KMS-encrypted S3 buckets, VPC endpoints, and incremental dbt models to keep data flowing reliably
              from raw JSON to analytics-ready marts.
            </p>
            <p class="muted">
              This is the same architecture pattern I adapt for client environments that want calm, well-understood data platforms.

              <h3>So what does this data tell us?</h3>
              <p>
                Taken together, the three views above are basically saying:
                big-tech is grinding higher over this window, options flow is consistently heavy,
                and the crowd is leaning hard into calls while volatility is elevated but not out of control.
              </p>

              <div class="stack" style="--stack-gap:0.5rem;">
                <h4>Trending up, with event-driven bursts</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Across AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and NVDA you see more +1-4% days than crash days.
                    Drawdowns show up, but they tend to get bought back within a few sessions rather than
                    turning into sustained downtrends.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The daily chart makes that clear for AAPL in particular: the stock walks from the
                    high-220s into the high-270s through a series of choppy days rather than one giant
                    gap. It's a “choppy uptrend with event-driven bursts,” not a calm drift or a crash regime.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="stack" style="--stack-gap:0.5rem;">
                <h4>Options flow is where the crowd gets loud</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Options volume doesn't move randomly; it spikes in clusters around specific dates.
                    For AAPL, “normal” options flow is about 1-1.5M contracts, but on hotspots like
                    2025-09-19 and 09-22 it jumps into the 5M+ range.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The 7-day average line and the <code>option_volume_vs_30d</code> feature make it easy
                    to see when today is just another day versus a “3x crowd day” where traders are
                    clearly paying attention.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Some names are structurally louder than others. NVDA routinely trades 5-9M contracts
                    a day with 7-day averages north of 5M even when spot is oscillating in a relatively
                    tight band. That's what a crowded options name looks like.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="stack" style="--stack-gap:0.5rem;">
                <h4>Volatility has a personality per ticker</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Realized volatility is elevated across the board, but it isn't chaos. AAPL, AMZN,
                    and MSFT mostly live in the 20-30% annualized range; NVDA spends more time higher;
                    MSFT is the relative “calm anchor” even as it grinds to new highs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    That gives each ticker a distinct “vol personality”: NVDA is consistently punchier,
                    MSFT is steadier, and GOOGL has a short early stretch of very high vol before settling
                    into a more normal band.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="stack" style="--stack-gap:0.5rem;">
                <h4>Where risk and attention actually concentrated</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The top-contracts table cuts through the tape and shows where flow really went:
                    short-dated calls clustered around nearby strikes (for example, 260-280 for AAPL,
                    ~180-210 for NVDA, ~500-550 for MSFT).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Calls dominate the list. Puts appear, but they're the exception, which is a quick
                    visual read that this window was skewed toward upside speculation or call-heavy hedging.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Many of the most active contracts now show DTE = 0 and last price $0.01. That's not
                    a bug-it just means they were heavily traded while “alive” and have since expired and
                    decayed, exactly what you'd expect for short-dated out-of-the-money flow.

                <h4>A compact “daily weather report” for non-quants</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The snapshot export gives each ticker a daily state vector: short-horizon returns,
                    realized vol, underlying and options volume versus a 30-day baseline, and call/put mix.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    That's enough for a head of data or analytics to answer “Is today normal or weird?”,
                    “Is this rally being chased in options?”, or “Is this selloff being hedged or faded?”
                    without staring at raw trade logs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The point isn't to predict the market-it's to give downstream dashboards, alerts,
                    and models a clean, consistent picture of price action and options behavior that lives
                    inside the warehouse instead of scattered across one-off CSVs.

            <h2>Private MWAA Environment</h2>
            <p>
              A hardened Airflow deployment running on AWS MWAA inside a fully private VPC. MWAA connects to ECR, CloudWatch Logs, KMS,
              Secrets Manager, and S3 through VPC endpoints. This ensures orchestration, logging, and image pulls all happen without public internet
              access.
            </p>
            <p class="muted">
              The same approach can be used to keep your schedulers and control plane traffic private while still integrating cleanly with
              AWS services and your data warehouse.

            <h2>In progress: Dashboards &amp; apps on top</h2>
            <p>
              A browser-based analytics layer built with tools like Plotly Dash on top of Snowflake marts. The goal is to provide
              straightforward views into pipeline health and market data without adding another brittle surface area to maintain.
            </p>
            <p class="muted">
              As the core platform stabilizes, these kinds of dashboards and lightweight apps become much easier to add safely.
